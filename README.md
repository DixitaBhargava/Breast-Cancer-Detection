Breast cancer is cancer that develops from breast tissue. Signs of breast cancer may include a lump in the breast, a change in breast shape, dimpling of the skin,
fluid coming from the nipple, a newly-inverted nipple, or a red or scaly patch of skin. In those with distant spread of the disease, there may be bone pain, swollen
lymph nodes, shortness of breath, or yellow skin. Breast Cancer is a common cancer for women around the world, and early detection of BC can greatly improve prognosis
and survival chances by promoting clinical treatment to patients early. This application tells us if a cell contains a malignant or benign cancer. The dataset is from
Kaggle website, which was updated and more used for the detection and analysis. Got a good knowledge about various ML models such as Logistic Regression, Decision 
Trees, Random Forest Classifier, SVM, GaussianNB, K-Neighbours Classifier.
